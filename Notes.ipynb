    "We are back at stage 1. Stage 2 will use the input from stage 1 as discussed before. We just have a new model architecture, which will use the sub-image sequence as the input, and the targets will be the extracted features sequences, which will be used as input into the Stage 2 Bayesian latent AR model. Also for the current work we consider all sub-windows to be non-overlapping."
