We just have a new model architecture, which will use the sub-image sequence as the input, and the targets will be the extracted features sequences, which will be used as input into the Stage 2 Bayesian latent AR model. Also for the current work we consider all sub-windows to be non-overlapping."

The only downside in this would be we will have a lot of subwindows of images, and this increased size will force the stage 2 Bayesian latent AR model to take a lot of time for execute and produce results. This work is in the notebooks 4, 5 and 6. Data are inside the data folder in the \"Overlapping_data\" subfolder."
